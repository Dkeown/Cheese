      <p>When I was a child, we were taught basic nutrition. I don't remember everything we were taught, but the one thing that stands out to me is that cheese is a good source of protein and calcium. I took that to heart. In my 37 years of life, I have never had a broken bone. I attribute that to the fact that I eat cheese daily and also don't play sports at all. But mostly, it's the cheese. I feel like I could probably be a vegan if it weren't for cheese. If I ever have a farm, I think I'll keep a few happy cows and goats and learn to make my own cheese. If I can't be vegan, I can at least make sure my cheese comes from happy holsteins.</p>
